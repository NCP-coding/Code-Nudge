const SubarraySumExplanation = `Think about how you can efficiently calculate the distance from each of the two given nodes (node1 and node2) to all other nodes reachable from them. Since each node has at most one outgoing edge, the path from any starting node is unique. Once you have these distances, how would you use them to find the node that minimizes the maximum of the two distances?`
